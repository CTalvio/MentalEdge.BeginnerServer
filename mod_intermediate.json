         "Name": "bs_banhammer",
         "DefaultValue": "1" // Set to 1 to enable the banhammer. The banhammer is a tool that kicks or bans players it evaluates to be too skilled for the server. The banhammer can be extensively tuned, but I recommend using one of the included presets, and including which one you are running in the server name. This way people will find beginner servers interchangeable, and know what type of skill level to expect.

Crossing this limit will still allow finishing the match. The player will even get a congratulatory message at the end.

         "Name": "bs_kd_limit",
         "DefaultValue": "2.5" // KD limit. The minimum KD needed for pilots to become ascended. Note that neither limit alone is enough for an ascension, both conditions have to be met for a pilot to ascend.

         "Name": "bs_stompkill_limit",
         "DefaultValue": "30" // A limit at which pilots will be banned, unless at a KD close to 1.0. Use to remove veterans stomping on the server. The mod will also ban someone mid-game, who is on track to achieve this killcount by the end of the match, though it errs on the side of caution in these cases.

         "Name": "bs_stompkd_limit",
         "DefaultValue": "3.6" // A hardish limit at which pilots will be banned mid-match. Unlike the ascension limit, if either this or the killcount condition is met, a ban is issued. The mod will allow early game KD to spike above this limit, but as more kills and deaths are accrued and the KD of pilot hence becomes more accurate, it will activate closer to this treshold.

         "Name": "bs_kd_maxspike",
